## üöÄ Features

### üîç Spell Corrector
Tackling spelling errors with cutting-edge AI models that understand the nuances of Sinhala language:
- **Missing Letters**: Spotting and filling in the gaps to restore word meaning.
  - Example: `‡∂Ö‡∂±‡∑î‡∂ú‡∂±‡∂∫` ‚ûî `‡∂Ö‡∂±‡∑î‡∂ú‡∂∏‡∂±‡∂∫`
- **Missing Diacritical Marks**: Adding crucial marks for accurate pronunciation and meaning.
  - Example: `‡∂±‡∑Ä‡∂≠‡∑ä‡∑Ä‡∂±‡∂±` ‚ûî `‡∂±‡∑Ä‡∂≠‡∑ä‡∑Ä‡∂±‡∑ä‡∂±`
- **Mismatch of Aspirated and Unaspirated Letters**: Correcting subtle yet significant errors.
  - Example: `‡∂¥‡∑è‡∂ß‡∂∏‡∑è‡∂Ω‡∑è‡∑Ä` ‚ûî `‡∂¥‡∑è‡∂®‡∂∏‡∑è‡∂Ω‡∑è‡∑Ä`

### ‚ú® Grammar Corrector
Ensuring your sentences are grammatically flawless:
- **Tense Corrections**: Picking the right tense to fit the context.
  - Example: `‡∂∏‡∂∏ ‡∑É‡∑ê‡∂∏‡∑Ä‡∑í‡∂ß‡∂∏ ‡∂∫‡∑è‡∂†‡∑ä‡∂§‡∑è ‡∂ö‡∂ª‡∂≠‡∑í.` ‚ûî `‡∂∏‡∂∏ ‡∑É‡∑ê‡∂∏‡∑Ä‡∑í‡∂ß‡∂∏ ‡∂∫‡∑è‡∂†‡∑ä‡∂§‡∑è ‡∂ö‡∂ª‡∂∏‡∑í.`
- **Subject-Verb Agreement**: Matching singular/plural subjects with the correct verbs.
  - Example: `‡∂ú‡∂Ç‡∂ú‡∑è‡∑Ä‡∑ù ‡∑Ä‡∑ö‡∂ú‡∂∫‡∑ô‡∂±‡∑ä ‡∂ú‡∂Ω‡∑è ‡∂∂‡∑É‡∑í‡∂∫‡∑í.` ‚ûî `‡∂ú‡∂Ç‡∂ú‡∑è‡∑Ä‡∑ù ‡∑Ä‡∑ö‡∂ú‡∂∫‡∑ô‡∂±‡∑ä ‡∂ú‡∂Ω‡∑è ‡∂∂‡∑É‡∑í‡∂≠‡∑í.`

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Under the Hood

### ü§ñ Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Tokenization, syntactic parsing, and semantic analysis ensure context-aware corrections without losing meaning.

### üß† Deep Learning Magic
- **LSTM**: Captures the long-term context in sentences for precise corrections.
- **RNN**: Handles sequential text efficiently, perfect for simpler tasks.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Machine Learning Techniques
- **Decision Trees**: Quick and effective for basic error detection and correction.

### üîç difflib
- Unlocks the power of similarity scoring to identify the closest word matches, helping to refine corrections with remarkable precision.
  
### ‚ú® Fuzzy Matching
- Bridges the gap between what‚Äôs written and what‚Äôs meant, offering smart approximations for typos and subtle spelling errors.
  
### üìö PySpellChecker
- Harnesses word frequency data to suggest intelligent, context-aware corrections, ensuring your text remains both accurate and natural.
